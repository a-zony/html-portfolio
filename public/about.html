<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Coding is a lifelong learning process. No matter you good you are as a coder, you still find yourself learning new 
  things. It may be a new programming language that you are learning, a new framework, or a new way of thinking.
  And that is the most beautiful aspect of coding.</p>

<p> It is really fun to take a break problem, and break it down into smaller pieces, and solve it. That is another very
 beautiful aspect about coding</p>
